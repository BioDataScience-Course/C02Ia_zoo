    abstract = "{Identifying and counting zooplankton are labour-intensive and time-consuming processes that are still performed manually. However, a new system, known as ZOOSCAN, has been designed for counting zooplankton net samples. We describe image-processing and the results of (semi)-automatic identification of taxa with various machine-learning methods. Each scan contains between 1500 and 2000 individuals \\&lt;0.5 mm. We used two training sets of about 1000 objects each divided into 8 (simplified) and 29 groups (detailed), respectively. The new discriminant vector forest algorithm, which is one of the most efficient methods, discriminates between the organisms in the detailed training set with an accuracy of 75\\% at a speed of 2000 items per second. A supplementary algorithm tags objects that the method classified with low accuracy (suspect items), such that they could be checked by taxonomists. This complementary and interactive semi-automatic process combines both computer speed and the ability to detect variations in proportions and grey levels with the human skills to discriminate animals on the basis of small details, such as presence/absence or number of appendages. After this checking process, total accuracy increases to between 80\\% and 85\\%. We discuss the potential of the system as a standard for identification, enumeration, and size frequency distribution of net-collected zooplankton.}",

abstract = {Dynamics of the subsurface (2–3 m) mesozooplankton (i.e., > 200 μm) in the Bay of Calvi (Corsica, France) were explored, combining time series (2004–2016) of 14 zooplankton groups, wind gusts, water temperature, nitrate and chlorophyll-a. Zooplankton data was obtained through image analysis. While contrasted group-specific seasonal patterns were observed, the most productive zooplankton annual event occurred in April (spring peak), concentrating on average 25% of the total annual abundance. A “typical” year was defined based on the annual succession of different community states, highlighting particular years (2007, 2015 and 2012) mainly characterized by weak spring peak. Environmental influences on the interannual variability of zooplankton were explored and while relationship between chlorophyll-a and zooplankton abundance was unclear, the availability of nutrients (December–March), potentially mediated via the wind regime (October–January) seemed to be essential to the occurrence of the spring peak. Additionally, we observed an influence of temperature, with winter thermal thresholds (between 12.1 °C and 13.4 °C) conditioning the spring peak. Also, the occurrence of lower annual abundances after 2010 was synchronous with the sharp increase of seawater warming trend, especially regarding winter temperature (0.30 °C.year−1). Finally, winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) was found to be correlated to both winter water temperature and spring peak abundance, which suggests large-scale processes to impact regional zooplankton community.}
